In [Ivan Sutherland’s 1994 talk about SKETCHPAD][22], he explains,
“The idea was that you draw the drawing first, and then fix it up
later,” (33'38" into the video) by adding constraints, for example by
adding parallelism and equal-length constraints.  And this is still
pretty similar to modern constraint-driven CAD programs like FreeCAD.

But on modern computers, we could imagine a wider variety of ways of
“fixing it up”.  For example, we could imagine smoothing out a crooked
line you’ve drawn, or converting it into a circle arc, or connecting
or disconnecting two lines, or cleaning up some text you’ve written,
or running handwriting recognition on it.  Perhaps buttons would pop
up next to recently drawn objects to offer you these opportunities.

This kind of successive approximation to the state you want is not
nearly as well supported in current drawing software as I think it
should be.
