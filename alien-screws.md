How would an advanced alien civilization design screws or similar
fasteners?

Three improvements in particular occur to me: bayonet connections,
two-quarters threads, and positive screwdriver coupling.

Bayonet connections like those used for camera lenses, BNC cables,
fluorescent light starters, and some kinds of lightbulbs (the English
standard) are far superior to screws in most cases, though they do
require a spring.

I understand that some barrels use threads that run around only one
quarter of the barrel, leave a slot for one quarter of the barrel, run
around another quarter of the barrel, then leave a slot for the final
quarter.  So, by rotating the barrel to the position where the threads
do not engage, you can just insert it translationally, then screw it a
quarter-turn to lock it into place.  This scheme also allows
fractional numbers of starts and variable mechanical advantage,
similar to bayonet connections, and of course you can use it with
larger numbers of starts as well.

Positive screwdriver coupling might involve a ball bearing that pops
out of the side of a square-drive screwdriver to engage a cavity in
the screw head, with a shim that slides into place inside the
screwdriver to lock the ball bearing in place.  A simpler design uses
an L-shaped screwdriver blade half the width of the screwdriver and a
shim that slides in behind it to push the bottom of the L into a slot
in the screw head.
