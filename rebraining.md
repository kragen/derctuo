One of the things I've been wanting to do is to make an autonomous
personal computing device, since one doesn't seem to be forthcoming
from the economy.  It seems likely the easiest way to do this is to
get an existing device with the right peripherals (power, input, and
output), remove its CPU and RAM, and implant a new microcontroller.

Scientific calculators seem particularly promising here, but I should
probably start with something easier, like a large four-banger.  See
[the note on screens](screens.md) for some details.
