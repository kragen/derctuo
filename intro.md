Derctuo is a book of notes on various topics, mostly science and
engineering with some math, from the first year of the COVID-19
pandemic, 02020 CE.  Its primary published form is a gzipped tarball
of 9MB of HTML files and sources,
although there’s also an inferior PDF version of about
1000 pages for reading on hand computers or printing.
It uses a page size slightly smaller than standard for improved
readability on hand computers.

My original plan was to write a reproducible
computation system so that the book would be entirely reproducible
from a minimal computational core, allowing all of its calculations to
be not only verified but also easily extended, reused, and studied.
I didn’t get very far on that plan.  Instead
it’s mostly just about a quarter million words of dead text, with some
static inline images, plus a [bundled library of source
material](notes/library), which is not included in the PDF version.

It contains some novel discoveries, but some of it is just my notes
from exploring the enormous feast of knowledge now available on the
internet to anyone who takes the time to taste of it, and some other
parts are explorations that didn’t pan out — left here only as a
cautionary tale to the next explorer.

There are lots of notes in here that aren’t “finished” in the usual
sense; they end in the middle of a sentence, or say “XXX”, or have a
note in them that the foregoing is wrong in such-and-such a way.  But
I am publishing the final version of Derctuo today.  I might make
future versions of some of these notes, but not of Derctuo itself.

Derctuo is the sequel to
[Dercuano](http://canonical.org/~kragen/dercuano), a larger collection
of my notes which I published in 02019.

Like Dercuano, Derctuo is lacking in scholarship: many of the notes
reflect fields I understand poorly, and so often they fall victim to
known pitfalls, and fail to describe how they relate to existing
knowledge.  It is best thought of as working notes published despite
their incomplete state.

Often in Derctuo, as in Dercuano, I refer to something being
“published”.  By this I generally mean “made public”.  There’s a
current fad in academia (over the last, say, half century) to use
“published” to mean “brought up to the standards of scholarly
publication and approved as such by means of scholarly peer review”.
This is usually not what I mean.

## Public-domain dedication ##

As far as I’m concerned, everyone is free to redistribute Derctuo, in
whole or in part, modified or unmodified, with or without credit; I
waive all rights associated with it to the maximum extent possible
under applicable law.  Where applicable, I abandon its copyright to
the public domain.  I wrote and published Derctuo in Argentina in
02020 (more conventionally called 2020, or 2020 AD).

The exception to the above public-domain dedication is the ET Book
font family used, licensed under [the X11
license](liabilities/LICENSE.ETBook).  This doesn’t impede you from
redistributing or modifying Derctuo but does prohibit you from
removing the font’s copyright notice and license (unless you also
remove the font).  The PDF embeds part of FreeFont and of the DejaVu
fonts, [whose copyright notices are also
included](liabilities/dejavu-copyright), but DejaVu and FreeFont are
not used in the HTML tarball.
