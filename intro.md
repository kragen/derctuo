Derctuo is a book of notes on various topics, mostly science and
engineering with some math, from the first year of the COVID-19
pandemic, 02020 CE.  Its primary published form is a gzipped tarball
of 9MB of HTML files and sources,
although there’s also an inferior PDF version of about
1000 pages for reading on hand computers.

My original plan was to write a reproducible
computation system so that the book would be entirely reproducible
from a minimal computational core, allowing all of its calculations to
be not only verified but also extended, reused, and studied.  Instead
it’s mostly just about a quarter million words of dead text, with some
inline images, plus a [bundled library of source
material](notes/library), which is not included in the PDF version.

It contains some novel discoveries, but some of it is just my notes
from exploring the enormous feast of knowledge now available on the
internet to anyone who takes the time to taste of it, and some other
parts are explorations that didn’t pan out — left here only as a
cautionary tale to the next explorer.

There are lots of notes in here that aren’t “finished” in the usual
sense; they end in the middle of a sentence, or say “XXX”, or have a
note in them that the foregoing is wrong in such-and-such a way.  But
I am publishing the final version of Derctuo today.  I might make
future versions of some of these notes, but not of Derctuo itself.

Derctuo is the sequel to
[Dercuano](http://canonical.org/~kragen/dercuano), a larger collection
of my notes which I published in 02019.
