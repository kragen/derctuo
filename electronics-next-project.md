I'm suffering from analysis paralysis as I ponder what electronic
project to do next to level up (to both level up my skills and my
equipment).  This is related to [the microcontroller
inventory](microcontroller-inventory.md) and [the nonshopping
list](ghettobotics-nonshopping-list.md).  Here are some 58 projects I
could try to do, in random order:

- **use a speaker as a microphone** to get bidirectional audio on a
  microcontroller.
- **make the strip of giant LEDs shine** so we can illuminate with it
- **audio amp** driving one or more of the speakers here
- **low-bandwidth 433MHz license-free SDR** for kilometer-scale robust
  communication
- **pulse soldering**: a circuit to deliver a calibrated amount of
  energy at a calibrated power level for, for example, battery pack
  construction or hair-wire soldering
- **ultra-low-power FM radio transmitter** to listen to music wirelessly
- **hot air pencil**: thermostatic control of air temperature permits
  rapid localized heating, very useful for rework and electronics
  scavenging, as well as preheat for soldering
- **ultrasound measurement** with two piezos and some oil, to see what
  frequencies I can get through the oil; this might require the Blue
  Pill
- **plant waterer** to keep the plants from dying; this probably
  involves a microwave oven relay, a washing machine valve, a
  microcontroller, and some transistors
- **timer with relay** to turn off the water pump after 20'
- **basic Magic Kazoo**: you hum into a microphone on one end, and it
  does pitch ID and synthesizes a musical instrument out the other
- **lightbulb thermometer** using a lightbulb as the temperature sensor
- **read the digital caliper's output port** to get another
  20-micron-precision positional feedback source
- **stepper controller**: drive a low-power stepper motor with some
  transistors and a microcontroller
- **an electromagnet**, pure and simple
- **electrolysis controller** to permit precise control of
  electroplating, electro-etching, and similar processes
- **copper-wire foam cutter** (see [Copper
  Segelin](copper-segelin.md))
- **micro-engraver** with three piezos, or two piezos and
  electro-etching, or one piezo and several electrodes, as a testbed
  for micro-engraving ideas
- **stainless steel wool foam cutter**: it's about 0.2Ω per 100mm,
  which is in the same ballpark as thinner copper wire for the [copper
  segelín](copper-segelin.md), but instead of burning at 300° it can
  get to over 800°, which is plenty for cutting styrofoam.
- **adjustable switching power supply** using discontinuous conduction
  mode to get current limiting
- **program the PALs** I scavenged to compute some particular logic
  function
- **noise-based optical position encoder**: by measuring randomly varying transmissivity or reflectivity along a linear track, it can rapidly determine its precise position
- **read and write SD card from AVR or STM32**: SD cards support SPI, and this enables a lot of projects that otherwise need way too much space.
- **display text on a 7-segment LED screen** from an AVR or STM32
- **air conditioner remote control** to control the air conditioner with infrared
- **FM radio receiver** to listen to the radio
- **Blue Pill oscilloscope**, only up to a megahertz or two but still better than a sound card
- **ultrasonic vector image transmission** (see [audio vector image](audio-vector-image.md))
- **program my ATMega328s with the Duemilanove**, the ones that are in a tube
- **program the ATTiny2313s** I have a tube full of here so I can use them for things like capacitance measurement
- **humidity sensor** (see [PET dielectric spectroscopy](pet-dielectric-spectroscopy.md))
- **make an MPPT to measure a red LED in the sun** to find out how much energy you can harvest from it and at what power level
- **recognize whistling with an AVR** to command household electronics
- **synthesize voice with AVR and speaker** to get output 
- **program the ATTiny45s** so I can use them for things like my notebook
- **dielectric spectroscopy**: identify materials, especially including humidity, capacitively through their frequency-dependent permittivity
- **program Blink onto one of the Blue Pills** so I can start using them
- **house thermometer** (indoor, outdoor, logging)
- **test the PAL delay line** I scavenged from a VCR
- **Lissajous projector**, scanning a laser pointer with a resonating
  nutating mirror.  Once the mirror has a stable resonance set up,
  maybe from a speaker, you can tune in a picture by moving a
  photodiode into the illuminated area to find the overall period,
  then to corners and across the center to find the phase
- **impedance tomography sensor** to detect touches on a resistive
  surface with just a few electrodes and a microcontroller
- **emulate a PS/2 keyboard** to get data from microcontrollers onto
  bigger computers (see [machine-readable microcontroller
  output](machine-readable-microcontroller-output.md))
- **build a simple circuit with hair wire** to see if it can be made
  feasible
- **data reception with bidirectional LEDs** as extensively tested
  for, among other things, PJON
- **linear motor with aluminum sheet** consisting of two or three
  coils that can levitate and move the sheet; this probably requires
  some pretty hefty power
- **thermostat-controlled microfurnace** for things like firing
  pottery
- **current microbalance** to weigh light things by counteracting
  their weight with a precisely measured electromagnetic force
- **Joule Thief** as a simple battery tester if nothing else
- **adjustable linear power supply** hanging off an ATX or power-brick
  power supply so I have an adjustable voltage; this becomes a lot
  more useful once it has some kind of readout, and ideally current
  limiting too; if it depends on the upstream power supply for voltage
  regulation it can be just a trimpot and an emitter follower
- **7-segment display** with 7 scavenged discrete LEDs in some kind of
  case with slits and partitions, which can be very large
- **TransistorTester**, maybe not a super sophisticated one
- **rotational capacitive sensor** made of paper towel tubes and
  aluminum foil to measure rotational position with some precision,
  thus providing feedback for DC motors
- **[capacitor meter](capacitor-meter.md)**: with Duemilanove, to
  begin with
- **test PS/2 keyboard** by programming the host side of the PS/2
  protocol into an AVR or STM32
- **decode a printer position sensor signal** of one of the two inkjet
  carriage assemblies I have here so as to get a 20-μm-precision
  motion control feedback system
- **4-wire ohmmeter** to measure sub-hectaohm resistances precisely
- **show text on a passive LCD** (ideally 7-segment at first; see [the
  note on screens](screens.md) and [rebraining](rebraining.md))
- **decode the microwave keyboard** so I can use it as a project box
  with membrane buttons
