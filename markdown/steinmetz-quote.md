I was reading Steinmetz's 1892 paper about hysteresis, and I was
struck by the readability and elegance of the prose used by learned
societies at the time, next to which most modern academic writing
feels leaden:

> The subject that we have to-night before us, and which you will find
> so ably dealt with by Mr. Steinmetz, relates to that phenomenon of
> molecular friction, which Mr. Ewing has denominated "hysteresis."
> Mr. Ewing, as we all know, has made the subject so peculiarly his own,
> that one might at first suppose there was nothing new to be known
> about it; but I am confident that after this paper is read, those of
> us who read it with Mr. Steinmetz will find that there is something
> new under the sun. We will now hear Mr. Steinmetz's paper.

This was at the beginning of 1892; in 1891 he had published
"Elementary Geometric Theory of the Alternate-Current Transformer" in
*Electrical Engineer*, volume (?) 11, 1891, "627ff. on p. 627; 12
(1891): 12ff."  He *also* published things in *German* starting in
*1890*: "Das Transformatorenproblem in elementargeometrischer
Behandlungsweise", *ETZ*, 11 (1890): 185-186, 205-206, 225-227,
233-234, 345-348, and in 1891, "Anwendung des Polardiagrams der
Wechselstrom für inductive Widerstände", *ETZ*, 12 (1891): 394-396,
405-407.

Here, in the Q&A, he tries to set that jackass Pupin straight about
some mistakes Pupin was making:

> On the other hand, to make the current considerable only for a
> moment, while immediately before and after it is small, either the
> induced E. M. F. must suddenly decrease enormously, and the next
> moment increase just as suddenly --- which is impossible, because it
> is the differential quotient of magnetism --- or the primary
> E. M. F. had to rise and decrease again very suddenly, and such a
> sudden rise, and immediately afterwards decrease of primary
> impressed E. M. F., not only is an electro dynamic alternator unable
> to produce, but no electric circuit would permit a current of such
> enormously large value and short duration to pass.
