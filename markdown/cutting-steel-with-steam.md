In [my note on cold plasma](cold-plasma.md) I wrote about the
possibilities of using cold plasma to slowly reduce metal, dissolve
away epoxy, and so on.  But it's also very useful to be able to
*oxidize* metal, especially iron, for example to cut it.  And, as I
found there, hydrogen can reduce iron from FeO at almost any
temperature as long as there's about 10× as much hydrogen as steam.
But that *also* means that *steam* can *oxidize* iron to FeO at almost
any temperature *until* 90% of the steam has been reduced by the iron.

This suggests the use of steam as a substitute for oxygen in an
oxy-acetylene cutting torch.

That's probably a dumb idea because probably you lose more than 79% of
the heat of oxidizing the iron to splitting up the water.  FeO's
melting point is 1377°, its enthalpy of formation is XXX ????, and
water's enthalpy of formation is -285 kJ/mol.
