If you have a knob with two ball bearings in its center with a shaft
running through them, and that shaft is connected via a hinge to
another shaft which is held in some position but not free to rotate,
then you can rotate the second shaft by changing the plane in which
the knob is without changing the angle at which the hinge is bent.
This is easy to do with your hand; the movement is the same as that
used to spin a Powerball gyroscope.  The knob functions as a
swashplate through which you can turn the second shaft with an
adjustable mechanical advantage, which can be arbitrarily small when
the angle between the shafts is arbitrarily small, and can go up to
the diameter ratio between the second shaft and the knob.

This amounts to a new kind of screwdriver, which allows you to unscrew
screws arbitrarily fast without a motor.  It does need some way of
being held in the screw.

I thought this might work especially well using a ball-end hex wrench,
with the second shaft being the screw itself, but I don't think that
works.
