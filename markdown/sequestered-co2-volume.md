Suppose we build big machines to remove CO₂ from the atmosphere to get
back down from 400 ppm back to pre-industrial levels.  If we froze all
that excess CO₂ into a big block of dry ice, how big would it be?

The [atmosphere] has a mass of about 5.15 × 10¹⁸ kg, and 0.414% of
that is CO₂, by volume.  The average molecular weight of dry air is
about 28.95 g/mol, while [CO₂] is 44.01 g/mol, making it 1.52 times
the density of dry air.  (The CO₂ page on WP says 1.53 times.)  This
means that CO₂ is about 0.629 / (0.629 + 100 - 0.414) = 0.628% of the
atmosphere by mass, or 3.25 × 10¹⁶ kg.  [Pre-industrial levels were
about 250 ppm][cc], so we only need to remove about 164 ppm, or
164/414 of the total; that's about 1.29 × 10¹⁶ kg.

The density of [dry ice] varies from 1.4–1.6 g/cc, so this would be
about 8–9 × 10¹² m³ of dry ice, roughly a cube 20 km on a side.  This
is the volume of about 50–60 trillion barrels of oil, almost a
thousand times the size of the Ghawar supergiant oil field, the
largest among the [40 000 or so oil fields in the world][oil field].

If you pump the CO₂ back into the ground, the high pressure will
convert it to highly compressed supercritical CO₂, almost the same
density as dry ice, so this is probably a reasonable estimate of how
much underground storage space is needed.
