In [CMG Walker](cmg-walker.md) I wrote about how to make a mobile
machine with a totally rigid and seamless surface: no joints, no
wheels, no flexion.

A glider or submarine of this sort could perhaps work exclusively by
moving its center of mass internally, like the OrbSwarm robots, rather
than using reaction wheels or CMGs; this is a significant part of how
hang-gliders work.  In the case of a submarine, a similar tactic can
alter its buoyancy, which can be used to propel it forward, though
this requires either a flexible surface or some transport of mass,
probably water, across the surface, for example through a hole.
