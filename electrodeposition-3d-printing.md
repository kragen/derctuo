Speculation
-----------

You can form an arbitrary iron shape by simultaneous electroforming
from a large number of parallel needles?  In a near-boiling,
oxygen-starved solution of hydrochloric acid, you can run current
through some needles, but not others, to promote the deposition of
iron on a cathode surface a short distance away (millimeters or less)
around just those needles.  By withdrawing the array of needles as the
cathode grows, the inter-electrode distance remains constant.  If the
needles are themselves iron, they will dissolve anodically and be
deposited (in electrolytically purified form) on the cathode, and will
need to be fed in through some kind of wire feed mechanism, but if
they are graphite or a noble metal, then iron must instead be supplied
in ferrous form by pumping in more electrolyte to replace the spent
electrolyte; pumping it through the centers of the needles themselves
is one possibility.

If the needles are moved laterally as well as being withdrawn, they
can produce features of finer detail than the spacing between needles.

And, of course, if the current is reversed, the same method produces
local anodic dissolution and becomes selective electrochemical
machining, rather than selective electrodeposition.

By dispersing fine graphite or amorphous carbon particles in the
electrolyte, so that some of it gets included in the iron deposits, it
is possible to deposit iron that can later be converted to steel by
heat treatment, causing the carbon to diffuse; this can be localized
to just certain layers of the workpiece.  Alternatively, the iron can
be case-hardened if the softness and ductility of pure iron is
undesirable.

Other metals commonly electroplated can be 3-D printed in the same
way; an Argentine savant has already demonstrated this process with
copper, but zinc, tin, chromium, nickel, gold, silver, cadmium,
cobalt, lead, and even some alloys such as bronze and brass can be
shaped in this way.  Additionally, layers of different metals can be
alternated, and fillers such as graphite, aluminum oxide, and clay
particles can be included, especially if the cathode voltage is kept
moderate enough to prevent bubbling.

Other liquid electrolytes, such as ionic liquids and perhaps even deep
eutectic systems, might permit the use of a wider range of metals,
more rapid electrodeposition of iron, or lower risks than a
near-boiling strong hydrochloric acid solution.

The needles, if iron, need not be pure iron; they can contain metallic
impurities as long as their standard electrode potential is
significantly more negative than iron's -0.44V.  In particular, zinc,
magnesium, aluminum, and the rare earths should not be a problem.
Most other metals, however, would plate out in preference to the iron,
including virtually everything you can electroplate in water (except
zinc and maaybe chromium).

Historical background
---------------------

In <https://www.finishing.com/94/56.shtml> there is some discussion of
different ways to electroform or electroplate with iron; Colin
Braathen writes:

Then Kushner gives the recipe: 40–60 oz./gal. of ferrous chloride
dihydrate, 20–35 oz./gal. of calcium chloride, 185–210°F, 20–80 amps
per square foot without agitation or up to 200 with agitation (which
must not be air to prevent oxidizing the ferrous ions), high-quality
iron anodes, pH 0.2–1.8 using HCl.  There is some confusion in the
recipe.
