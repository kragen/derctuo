	Building GNU FreeFont

The only files that are "built" in this project are binary font files.
They are built using FontForge, which must be installed before any
build is done.

To build all the font files, just cd to the top directory and type
	make
(this will also work from within the sfd/ directory.)

Several special build targets are also present:
	ttf	TrueType format fonts only
	otf	OpenType format fonts only
	woff	WOFF format fonts only

	ttfzip	.zip archive of TrueType format fonts
	otftar	tarball of OpenType format fonts
	woffzip	.zip archive of WOFF format fonts
	srctar	tarball of sources

	tests	run a battery of tests on the sources and built files

	clean
