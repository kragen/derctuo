Derctuo: a sequel to Dercuano
=============================

[Dercuano]: http://canonical.org/~kragen/dercuano

I collected [Dercuano] last year, 02019 CE, and wrote some of it; but
most of it was written over the 14 years leading up to 02019.  Many of
my ambitions for Dercuano were not realized: I wanted it to be not
merely a hypertext but also a repository of highly reproducible and
observable computational experiments, with the hypertext aspect being
merely one aspect of the system’s total capabilities.  However, I
worried that perfectionism on this axis could prevent the repository’s
publication in practice.  So the calculations and system models in
Dercuano were mere dead text — I ran the calculations in Python, or in
units(1), or in JS, or whatever, then copied and pasted the results
into notes in Dercuano.  And the little code I did write for Dercuano
itself, I mostly wrote in Python and ran from the Makefile.

Shortly after I finished Dercuano, I wrote [an SDF-based
skeletonization experiment][2] based on some font-rendering problems
I’d had in Dercuano.  This is the kind of thing I want in Derctuo.
