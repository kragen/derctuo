One of the problems with refractory materials is that they tend to be
brittle at room temperature.  The ductile-brittle transition of a
material, if it exists, tends to be not too far from its melting
point, so materials that are ductile at room temperature tend to not
survive 1000° or 1500°, with a few exceptions.

As a result, when they heat up and cool down, they tend to crack.

The Neolithic solution to this was to pit-fire pottery: you bury it in
a pit and throw burning coals on it, then, perhaps, cover up the pit,
partly or fully, with dirt.  It's fine if the dirt is brittle and
cracks, because it's already powder; you aren't demanding any strength
of it.  If it crumbles, it crumbles onto the other dirt and pot
underneath it.

A modern equivalent of this is the salt bath or sand bath used by
opticians and labs to heat up materials to a desired temperature,
either to partly melt or soften them, or to provoke some reaction.

It occurred to me that you can do this with heating elements in the
salt or sand, thus achieving a high-temperature capability without
constructing a castable refractory with any kind of strength.  Quartz
sand is cheap, and olivine sand isn't that expensive.  You can jam
temperature sensors into the sand too, and they might be able to be at
a significant distance from the thing that's heating up, so they can
be at a lower temperature.

Vermiculite, charcoal, and ash may also be usful.
