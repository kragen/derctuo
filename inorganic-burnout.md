Foamed pottery, as described in [Cyclic Fabrication
System](cyclic-fabrication-systems.md), is a broadly useful product,
easily improving the properties of fired-clay ceramics for a number of
uses.  However, in its usual form, not only does it make a terrible
smell; it also requires organic materials as an input, actually in
larger volume than the clay; it requires oxygen to react with the
materials; and it requires a fairly high temperature, at a bare
minimum 250° but typically more like 800°.  These requirements are not
always desirable or feasible.

There are other uses for solids that can be thus "burned out" without
disturbing surrounding materials; they can be used as support material
for initially unsupported things, for example during assembly or 3-D
printing, and investment casting and other lost-wax casting relies on
burning out the wax from the mold.  Similarly, in lost-foam casting,
the foam pattern is burned out of the mold by the hot metal being
cast.

So what kinds of materials would make good candidates for such
processes?

Potential evaporants
--------------------

If you need to do your burnout at low temperatures, carbon dioxide
sublimes at -79° and is very cheap and pretty inert.  A number of
other common compounds are solid at accessible temperatures below room
temperature and are then easily evaporated, such as ammonia (-78°,
boiling at -33°), sulfur dioxide (-72°, boiling at -10°), and water
(0°).  However, I can't think of any such compounds that don't melt
first at atmospheric pressure or are totally nonpolar like CO₂;
nonpolar compounds mostly tend to have a pretty wide liquid range,
which is annoying here.  At even lower temperatures the toxic,
inflammable [CS₂](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_disulfide), may
be an option, melting at -112°, but it doesn't boil until 46°!  It's
famous for dissolving insoluble things like cellulose, phosphorus,
rubber, sulfur, and asphalt.

[Hyponitrous acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponitrous_acid) is
an inorganic solid, if a dangerously unstable one, which spontaneously
decomposes to nitrous acid and water over weeks **at room
temperature**.  I'm not clear on whether this decomposition takes
place in solid form or not, or what its boiling point is.

[Ammonium nitrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrite)
also slowly decomposes to water and nitrogen even at **room
temperature**; perhaps it is stable at some lower temperature, but
usually it is stabilized instead by an alkaline aqueous solution.
However, it, too, is dangerously unstable under many circumstances.

[Hydroxylamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylamine) itself,
used as a photographic developer, might be a reasonable candidate:
it's an inorganic solid, melting at **33°** and decomposing at 58°,
but unstable in a poorly-understood way.  Still, its flashpoint isn't
until 129°, and its oral LD₅₀ is around 400 mg/kg, which sounds
considerably more innocent than most of the amines mentioned below.

[Pyrosulfuric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfuric_acid)
melts at **36°** but may not be a good idea, being strong enough to
*protonate sulfuric acid*.  Moreover, I'm pretty sure that when it
decomposes from heating, it decomposes into SO₃ and sulfuric acid.

[Dinitrogen
pentoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_pentoxide) melts
at **41°** and boils at 47°.  It's a strong oxidizer and a strong
acid, of course, but much less horrifying than the more common
nitrogen oxides, which it will produce in ultraviolet light.
Eventually it decomposes to nitrogen dioxide and oxygen even at room
temperature, though.

[Ammonium
bicarbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_bicarbonate)
decomposes into ammonia, water, and carbon dioxide at **42°** and is
widely thus as a leavening agent for cookies and crackers, as well as
an acidity regulator, fertilizer, and fire extinguishing agent.
Decomposition is already rapid at 36°.  It's an irritant that can
cause lung damage.

[Caro's acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxymonosulfuric_acid)
melts at **45°** but is probably contraindicated, being dangerously
unstable itself and "one of the strongest oxidizers known".

[NH₃OHNO₃](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylammonium_nitrate) is
another inorganic solid; it melts at **48°** and decomposes somewhere
in the 200°–300° range, but it is also very toxic and, except in
aqueous solution, dangerously unstable.

[Cyanogen bromide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanogen_bromide), a
common organic synthesis reagent, is an inorganic solid which cleaves
peptide bonds and reacts with water to produce HCN and HOBr.  It also
has a tendency to produce cyanide while in storage.  It melts around
**50°** and then boils around 61°.  Unlike almost every other material
on this list, it contains no oxygen, but it does contain carbon.

[Ammonium carbonate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_carbonate)
decomposes into ammonia and carbon dioxide at **58°** and is used like
ammonia bicarbonate for leavening, often in a mixture, as well as an
emetic and photographic lens cleaner.

[Ammonium carbamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_carbamate)
occurs with the carbonate and bicarbonate, with which it is used as
leavening (and with which it spontaneously interconverts), and it
decomposes at **60°**, also to ammonia and carbon dioxide.

[Marshall's acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroxydisulfuric_acid)
is similar to Caro's acid but instead decomposes without melting at
**65°** and, I think, isn't itself dangerously unstable, as long as
you keep it far away from any organics.  I imagine that it decomposes
into mostly SO₃, though.

[Ammonium sulfite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_sulfite),
used as a food additive, a photographic fixer, and a safer alternative
to lye for straightening hair, also decomposes at **65°**, into
"sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen".  It's also used to make
blast-furnace refractory-lining bricks; US patent 2,724,887 from 1955
explains that in aqueous solution it works as a source of a sulfite
ion which oxidizes to sulfate and somehow prevents iron-oxide
contamination in the bricks from causing them to disintegrate under
blast-furnace conditions.  (Mysteriously, though, he forgot to patent
this, patenting only the use of lithium chloride for the same
purpose.)

In [Project Pluto](http://www.merkle.com/pluto/pluto.html "The Flying
Crowbar, Gregg Herken, *Air & Space*, April/May 1990") a similar
purpose in assembling a hot reactor was answered with naphthalene
mothballs, which [melts at **80°** and boils at
216°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphthalene), requiring no oxygen.
They also sublime pretty rapidly at room temperature, typically
millimeters per month (or, in SI units, hundreds of picometers per
second.)  But mothballs are still organic.

Just plain crystalline [sulfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur)
melts at **115°**.  In air it will burn enthusiastically shortly
thereafter (its flashpoint is 160°, its [autoignition
temperature](http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics1166.htm)
232°), but absent oxygen, it boils at 448°.

[Hydroxylammonium
sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylammonium_sulfate) is a
stabler and less toxic salt of the hydroxylamine mentioned above; it's
used in color film emulsions, decomposing at **120°** to SO₃, N₂O,
NH₃, and water, in a reaction exothermic if heated past 138°.  It
[irritates skin but won't even damage your eyes if you splash it in
them](http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0898.htm);
however, it's acidic and a strong reducing agent.

The inorganic solid [ammonium
persulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_persulfate), used
in hair bleach and as a food additive, also decomposes at **120°**.
However, though its toxicity is relatively low, it's a strong enough
oxidizing agent to oxidize copper and nickel, and it's very acidic.
Worse, I imagine that when you do manage to decompose it, it
decomposes into ammonia and Caro's acid.

The inorganic solid [Hydroxylammonium
chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxylammonium_chloride)
decomposes around **156°**, but I don't know what it decomposes into.
I'm guessing that nitrogen oxides, probably hydroxylamine, nitric
oxide, and hydrogen chloride would be in the mix; maybe nitroxyl,
hyponitrous acid, and/or hydrogen, too.

[NH₄NO<sub>3</sub>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate) is
another solid that can be entirely decomposed with moderate heating,
sometimes [in a dangerous chain
reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut_blast).  It melts at
**170°** and decomposes exothermically at 210°.  This decomposition can
produce relatively innocent nitrous oxide and water; even more
innocent oxygen, nitrogen, and water; or deadly and caustic acids,
ammonia, and acidic nitrogen oxides; depending on the conditions of
decomposition.  It, too, is entirely inorganic.  An additional
disadvantage, or advantage, is that it deliquesces above 59% humidity
at 30°, or even lower humidities at higher temperatures.

[Ammonium
thiosulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_thiosulfate) is a
photographic fixer, fertilizer, defoliant, and nontoxic cyanide
alternative for heap-leach mining of gold and silver.  It presumably
decomposes if you heat it up enough, but I don't know at what
temperature; different sources suggest
[**180°**](https://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB8171755.htm)
or
[150°](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ammonium-thiosulphate#section=Melting-Point).
It decomposes to sulfur oxides and ammonia, normally, though sometimes
it can produce hydrogen sulfide, and even without heating, it can
corrode even copper.

[Sodium persulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_persulfate)
is an almost non-hygroscopic compound used as a hair bleach, a soil
conditioner, an oxidizer for zinc, a pickling agent for copper, and a
polymerization initiator which decomposes at **180°**.  Presumably
this yields sulfur oxides, probably SO₃, and possibly oxygen, and
leaves behind a sodium oxide residue, which doesn't boil until 1950°.
In some situations, for example in fired-clay pottery, this residue
may be tolerable; most of the other anions mentioned here can be used
with sodium similarly, but I will mostly focus on burnout without
residue.

[NH₄ClO<sub>4</sub>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_perchlorate)
is an inorganic solid that decomposes around **200°** into HCl,
nitrogen, oxygen, and water, but it's exothermic enough that this can
be dangerous; its autoignition temperature is only 240°.  It's also a
fairly widely used oxidizer.  Its acute toxicity is low, but its
chronic toxicity is high, and of course the decomposition products are
caustic.

[Ammonium sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_sulfate) is
another inorganic solid that can be entirely decomposed by heat at
**235°–280°**, producing ammonia, nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and water.
It's pleasantly stable and nontoxic, being widely used as a
fertilizer, a food additive, 30% of worldwide fine particulate
pollution, and (refreshingly for this list) a flame retardant.
[Ammonium bisulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_bisulfate)
is an intermediate product in the decomposition, melting at 147°, for
better or worse.

[Ammonium chloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_chloride),
when heated to **338°**, decomposes into ammonia and hydrogen
chloride.  These are presumably quite caustic in the gas phase, but
are known to recrystallize innocently on delicate fossils to reform
ammonium chloride.  And ammonium chloride is entirely inorganic, and
could even be used if oxygen were scarce.

[Phosphorus
pentoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus_pentoxide) melts
at **340°** and then boils at either 360° or 423°?  I don't understand
this but I don't want it going on anywhere near me.  Phosphorus oxides
are very complicated and hard to predict, and they tend to be
hygroscopic.
