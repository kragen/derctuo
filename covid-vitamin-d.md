Today the study [“Vitamin D Status in Hospitalized Patients With
SARS-CoV-2 Infection”][0] was published.  The key point from the
abstract is

>  Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of COVID-19 cases and 47.2%
>  of population-based controls (p<0.0001)… No causal relationship was
>  found between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity as a
>  combined endpoint or as its separate components.

This strongly suggests a causal role for vitamin-D deficiency in
COVID-19 hospitalization, and probably in risk of infection.  This
might explain some of the curious patterns, where the previously
healthiest countries are the ones where COVID-19 has spread fastest.

Bayesian calculation
--------------------

Let's take a look at the basis for this statistic:

> including 216 patients aged ≥ 18 years, with confirmed COVID-19
> admitted to the University Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla in
> Santander, Northern Spain from March 10 to March 31, 2020, and 197
> sex-matched population-based controls recruited from the Camargo
> Cohort (14,15) during their last follow-up visit on January–March of
> the past year.

During that period [Spain went from 3'258 confirmed COVID-19 cases to
111'541][1],
