The humans like to memorialize dates by holding annual celebrations.
What kinds of dates would a hacker culture memorialize?

I'm putting together a date table here in a sort of cuckoo-hash
fashion: most dates commemorate individual hackers, and for most of
the hackers the relevant known dates are their birthdate and their
death date.  When there is a collision, I can usually move the person
in question to a different relevant date: their death date if they're
listed at their birthdate, or vice versa.
