So, I have some basic gifted, bought, or lent electronics equipment: a
multimeter with a broken lead and I think broken current measurement, a
low-temperature hot glue gun, an audio cable, an amplified
battery-powered speaker, a non-temperature-controlled soldering iron
that leaks some mains current into the workpiece, a Blue Pill, an
ST-Link, a couple laptops, a netbook, some USB chargers and cables, a
USB power pack, some tin snips, some yogurt cups, some acetic
transparent silicone caulk, a couple of cellphones running Android, some
quartz-halogen lightbulbs, some butane lighters, a butane blowtorch,
some box cutters, a vise-grip, nail polish, ethanol, some nail-polish
diluent, some Q-tips, needlenose pliers, a scrap terry-cloth towel, some
electrical tape, a carpentry tape measure, a hammer, some chopsticks, an
electric screwdriver, some hex tips for it, and some popsicle sticks.
My current objective is to bootstrap from this to a reasonable
electronics lab, buying a minimal additional amount and replacing as
many as possible of the bought items with custom items, made out of
garbage.

Of these, I think it's reasonable to list the following as reusable
electronics-workshop equipment:

1. a multimeter
2. glue gun
3. soldering iron
4. Blue Pill
5. ST-Link
6. box cutters
7. needlenose pliers

Recent repairs and improvisations
---------------------------------

Although listing my numerous follies would probably help people to avoid
repeating them, these are just the successes.

### Soldering sponge ###

The soldering iron came with a stamped-steel stand to hold the tip off
your workbench.  But to clean the tip of a soldering iron (and also to
reduce the temperature of a non-temperature-controlled iron like this
one) you need a tip cleaner.  Typically this is a wet cellulose
sponge.  But all the sponges here are polyurethane, which would not
work; it would melt onto the tip instead of cleaning it.

So I cut a square of some 70 mm from the terry-cloth towel with the
tin snips, wet it, and put it under the soldering iron stand.  The
towel turns out to be cotton, so this works well.

### Multimeter lead repair ###

I repaired the broken multimeter test lead by using some modeling wax
(paraffin + rosin) as flux.  To solder the wire, I carved back the
plastic around the broken wire with the box cutter, stripped the wire
with the flush cutters, fluxed the wires, tinned them with some solder
from generous joints in a discarded VCR, and touched them together,
held in my hand.

To reinsulate it, I should have used hot glue, but instead I used
transparent silicone caulk; this sticks inadequately to the plastic,
isn't stiff enough to provide adequate strain relief, took a day to
cure, and may turn the wire into copper acetate.

To stiffen it, I squirted hot glue all over it, wrapping it all the
way around the silicone in places, since the EVA sticks inadequately
to the silicone.  The hot glue didn't stick adequately to the plastic,
making it a strain concentrator instead of a strain relief; this
turned out to be because a thin layer of silicone was in between.

I melted the hot glue with a butane stove lighter, scraped the molten
hot glue out of the way with a popsicle stick coated in silicone, and
then removed the intrusive silicone.  Then I used nail polish diluent
and a Q-tip to scrub the plastic, then applied more hot glue to
complete the repair.

### Solder braid ###

I cut a meter from the power cord of a pressure washer I had found
disassembled and discarded on the sidewalk a few months ago; after
slitting the end of the outer insulation with a box cutter, I was able
to pull one of the inner insulated conductors out to tear the outer
insulation lengthwise, just using my hand.  It contained two stranded
copper wires made of dozens of 100-μm-wide strands.  (I measured using
the cellphone as microscope; see below.).  I separated out three hanks,
trimmed them with the flush cutters, tied them into an overhand knot,
and began braiding.  After I had 220 mm of braid, I cut it at both ends
with the flush cutters.  I then heated it with the soldering iron to
coat it with the modeling wax as flux.

This solder braid makes it enormously easier to scavenge soldered
parts with large or numerous pins.

### Cellphone as microscope and flashlight ###

My cellphone can focus down to about 70 mm.  This body is so old that it
can no longer focus its eyes closer than about 210 mm.  The cellphone is
a little less clear than these eyes; they can read 3.8-mm-tall text from
1600 mm, while the camera can only read it from about 900 mm.  (This
works out to about 3.8/6/1600 ≈ 400 μrad ≈ 1'20" of resolution for the
eyes, or 700 μrad or 2'30" for the camera; double these numbers for
resolution in terms of distance between lines.)  So even without any
additional optical magnification the cellphone can provide about 1.7×
magnification of small objects, and of course it's easy to expand the
resulting blurry pictures on the screen to be much larger, which I
measure as 20× the linear size of the original object; this doesn't make
any new details visible but does make the same details more obvious.

It is of course common to use cellphones as flashlights or to use an
LED on them to illuminate an object being photographed.

Attempts to use cheap pocket Fresnel magnifiers to improve the
resolving power of the cellphone have so far met with failure.  I'm
considering buying one of those "60×" clip-on "cellphone microscopes".

Closeup image quality is improved substantially by supporting the
cellphone on top of a table on a a 75-to-76-mm-tall triangular prism,
with triangle sides of 55, 55, and 60 mm, folded from a 75-mm-wide
strip cut from a cardboard box discarded by the supermarket using box
cutters, measured with the tape measure, marked with a ballpoint pen,
and taped into shape using electrical tape.  The triangle firmly
supports the cellphone's center of gravity and the place where you
have to tap to take a photo, without obstructing its camera, "flash",
light sensors, or power button.  This reduces non-parallelism,
eliminates motion blur, and keeps the imaging range near optimal.

Both of the cellphones I happen to have here are more or less
equivalent for this.

Breadboards and jumper wires
----------------------------

A standard solderless breadboard is extremely useful for prototyping
and testing circuits.  But the original breadboards were actual
boards, made of wood, used for the same purpose; to connect two or
more components, you would put their leads under a washer, dished
outwards, and screw the washer to the board to pinch their leads under
its edge, making a tight connection.  This is feasible but far less
convenient than the now-standard approach.

In my childhood, I would take government welfare cheese boxes and poke
electronic components through the non-corrugated, non-plastic-coated
cardboard.  Panel-mount components I would poke through all the way,
then screw them down to the cardboard as normal; for through-hole
components, I would poke just the leads through.  Then I could connect
the leads inside the box using alligator-clip jumpers.  All of this was
made easier by the use of parts that hadn't been used yet, so the leads
were still long, and the near complete nonexistence of surface-mount
parts.  This approach is convenient; construction paper is of the
appropriate weight, and so are the inner and outer walls of single-wall
corrugated cardboard, which can be soaked apart in water.

A disadvantage to this approach is that it doesn't scale to more than
a few dozen connections.

At the time, I also had a Radio Shack "300 in 1" electronics kit,
which had about 50 components mounted on a piece of cardboard next to
some extension springs.  By thumbing a spring to the side, you opened
up space between its coils to insert one or more wires into.

In some YouChube video, _Espacio de César_ demonstrated the construction
of a now-conventional solderless breadboard from a pile of 2.54-mm-pitch
DIP sockets; he snipped out the middle of the sockets, stacked five
socket sides together, and wired them up in the conventional way.  I
suspect that even a very modest effort in this direction would yield
useful results: three 8-pin molex female connectors or socket sides
stacked up would be sufficient for a fairly wide variety of circuits
with discrete through-hole components.

Other candidate sources of such female connectors include connectors on
cables and jumpers for configuring boards by connecting two such
adjacent pins.

The usual way to use the now-conventional breadboard is with jumper
wires made of hookup wire with nothing on the ends, but you can also
solder traditional male pins onto the ends of wires in order to make
it easier to plug and unplug them.

The absolute minimum hardware for that kind of convenient plugging and
unplugging *of pins* is female-female jumper wires: basically a
single-pin female molex connector soldered onto each end of a jumper
wire.  You engulf a lead of a component with each pin, thus setting up a
two-terminal net.  Nets with three or more terminals can be constructed
with Y-shaped female–female–male jumpers, which additionally have a
third wire attached with a male pin on it; these can be daisy-chained to
make nets of any degree of complexity.

These female–female jumpers seem to be more or less the standard that
the Arduino world is converging on: each component is on its own little
PCB, with some 2.54-mm-pitch pins sticking off the edge.  (I've even
seen such a PCB for an ULN2803, which is a 2.54-mm-pitch DIP with eight
Darlingtons on it.)  You can either plug it into your breadboard or you
can hook up each of the pins directly to some other pin on some other
board with a female–female wire.  Often, 1970s-style rainbow cable is
involved between the two ends of the cable.

If I rip apart a largish motor, dead or otherwise, I can get many meters
of thick magnet wire out of it, which is directly suitable for use as
breadboard-style hookup wire once you sand its ends.  For
very-low-frequency or very-low-current circuits, twisty ties from bread
bags can also be used; and jumper wires from single-sided PCBs can
sometimes work for short distances.

So, connectors are the most immediate, urgent necessity.

Tool chest
----------

How can the lab fit into a portable toolchest?  Suppose it's 15 kg, if
it has wheels, and maybe 200 mm × 400 mm × 500 mm, an acceptable size to
carry on the bus, stuff under your seat, or carry through a doorway.
(This ATX tower PC in front of me is 200 mm × 450 mm × 450 mm, a very
similar size, though a marginally more inconvenient one.)

The toolchest needs to be able to contain the 7 pieces of equipment I
have, plus the 27 other pieces of equipment I want, and the 44 kinds of
consumable parts.  In a very crude averaging sense this allocates about
190 g to each of these 79 "items", including the toolchest itself, and
just over 500 mℓ per "item".  Because any item larger than these
averages must be compensated for by items additively smaller, the vast
majority will need to be smaller than that; I think it makes sense to
"budget" 40 g and 100 mℓ per "normal item" in order to have space left
over for the few that can't squeeze in that way.

As some motivating examples, this multimeter — a lightweight handheld
one — weighs 152 g without its leads, 202 g with its leads, and occupies
70 mm × 25 mm × 125 mm without its leads, 219 mℓ.  The flush cutters
weigh 64 g; the soldering iron weighs 174 g with its stand and "sponge".
The iron is some 230 mm long and, with the cord, 60 mm in diameter, thus
occupying some 650 mℓ.  The flush cutters occupy 150 mm × 60 mm × 10 mm
when closed, thus some 90 mℓ, the only item to come in under the 100 mℓ
"normal item" threshold, though they exceed the weight threshold by more
than half.

So the vast majority of "items" need to be much smaller than this, and
probably these three in particular need to be replaced by smaller and
lighter items.

Suppose the items have a Zipf distribution of weight and volume, which
is maybe pessimistic but probably not much.  Then the first ten weights
would be 3 kg (perhaps the 3-D printer), 1.5 kg, 1 kg, 750 g, 600 g,
then 500 g, 430 g, 380 g, 340 g, 300 g; the next ten between 150 and
275 g; the next ten between 100 and 150 g; the next ten between 75 and
100 g; the next ten between 60 and 75 g; the next ten between 50 and 60
g; the next ten between 43 and 50 g; and the last nine between 38 and 43
g.  In particular this gives the quartiles as about 50, 100, and 150 g.
And the top few volumes out of 40 ℓ are 8 ℓ, 4 ℓ, 2.7 ℓ, 2 ℓ, 1.6 ℓ,
etc.; and the quartiles are roughly 130 mℓ, 200 mℓ, and 400 mℓ.

This suggests that my "normal item" quotas above were maybe a bit too
stingy.  A "normal item" can be 100 g and 200 mℓ; every item over the
threshold must be compensated for by an item below it.  Still, of the
three test items, only the flush cutters are under these thresholds.

Suppose the resistors are close to the median and I have, say, 1000
resistors.  (An SMD sampler book I was looking at online has 25
resistors of each of 170 values, 4250 resistors in all.  It costs about
US$8 overseas but about US$50 in Argentina.)  Then the resistors average
100 mg each and 200 μℓ each.  Right now I have about 50 resistors (five
of which are trimpots) and they weigh about 3 grams, so I think this is
realistic.

But how can I keep them organized?  This is actually far more pressing
than the problem described above of how to reduce the multimeter's
weight by half; to build circuits with the hundreds of components I've
already scavenged from discarded machinery, I must be able to find the
components I need quickly, I must be able to connect them together, and
then I must be able to probe the resulting assemblage in some way to
find out why it's broken.

Ideally I'd press the "heat" button to heat the smart tweezers' tips to
desoldering temperature, pick up a component with them, and the smart
tweezer would chime, indicating that the component had been successfully
characterized; I could then press a "print" button with my foot, storing
the test results and printing a tiny envelope describing the component
and giving the crucial test values.  Then I would put the component into
the envelope, and file the envelope in the larger envelope for its type.

A common 100-mW 0805 resistor is 2 mm × 1.25 mm × 0.5 mm, totaling
1.25 mm³ or 1.25 μℓ; you can fit 800 of them in a milliliter.  So the
whole collection of 4250 resistors mentioned earlier would, without the
paper, amount to some 6 mℓ.
