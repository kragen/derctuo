In [Muriate Thermal Mass] I did some basic evaluation of the
reversible hydration of the dihydrate of muriate of lime to the
hexahydrate as a way to store up heat.

[Muriate Thermal Mass]: muriate-thermal-mass.md

I concluded that it was a very attractive alternative to the
miraculous salt of Glauber for domestic space heating applications,
because although it needs to be heated to 45.5° to recharge it, by my
calculations it holds 408 kJ/kg of heat energy and can produce
temperature rises of well over 100°; and it’s considerably more
flexible in when it releases that heat, instead of trying to release
it all the time and needing to be somewhat restrained by thick thermal
insulation.

However, I now conclude that I had only begun to scratch the surface
of the amazing possibilities of such systems; the [Cromer cycle] is
just the beginning.

It may be that all of this is irrelevant now that photovoltaic panels
are becoming so cheap, with module prices down to 15¢ per peak watt,
that collecting the large amounts of solar heat that make these things
attractive is actually more expensive than just storing energy in
batteries.  I suspect not, though; more exploration of this theme
below.

Heating
-------

In [Muriate Thermal Mass] I described the use of muriate of lime a
desiccant for heating in the following process, which turns out to be
well-known:

1. Heat the desiccant to regenerate it, driving off water vapor, for
   example with sunlight.
2. Store the dry desiccant until it is desired to heat, for example,
   your floor, your blanket, the air in your house, or some hot water.
3. Add water to the dry desiccant to produce the desired heat, which
   can be produced either at the point where it’s desired, or
   transferred using some kind of liquid coolant.
4. Store the spent desiccant until heat is available to regenerate it,
   for example from sunlight.

Alternative desiccants
----------------------

Although in the above I chiefly referred to the properties of the
muriate of lime, many other possible desiccants exist and could be
thus applied, including alabaster, amorphous mesoporous magnesite,
zeolites, silica hydrogel, ferric chloride, polyacrylate of sodium,
pearl-ash, salt, sugar, silica aerogel, chloride of zinc, oil of
vitriol, activated charcoal, soda-ash, lye, the bromide or muriate or
nitrate of lithia, quicklime, oxide of phosphorus, nylon 6,
carnallite, chloride or sulfate or perchlorate of magnesia,
waterglass, infusorial earth, cellulose-rich waste plant material such
as sawdust and straw, porous dehydrogenated hydroxide of alumium,
fired clay ceramic, *unfired* clays, other desiccants, and mixtures of
the above.

Different desiccants have different tradeoffs, and some may not be
well suited to some uses; for example, perchlorate of magnesia must be
regenerated under vacuum, quicklime must be regenerated at the
inconveniently high temperature of 512°, and the hydration of
alabaster only produces a temperature rise of some 60° or less.  It’s
unlikely that muriate of lime is the optimal choice, but I haven’t
investigated the tradeoffs thoroughly.

One of the chief figures of merit here is the price — either per joule
or per kg of water absorbed.  Other relevant quantitative information
includes the minimal relative humidity the desiccant can reach, the
temperature needed to regenerate it, the maximum temperature rise it
can produce, its water capacity, and its energy capacity.  Relevant
qualitative information includes whether it is solid or liquid, its
viscosity if liquid, its tendency to clump if solid (fixable in some
cases with larnite or similar substances), and its hazards if spilled
or inhaled.

But let’s look at prices first.

Muriate of lime, or oil of lime, has been one of the chief desiccants
used for centuries, and it is relatively cheap — US$1.60/kg here in
Argentina, for example, as I noted in Dercuano.  A few other
candidates approach or excel this price.  Slaked lime sells for
US$0.12/kg at retail here, and alabaster as the hemihydrate for about
US$0.40/kg, and the [USGS gives its wholesale price][alabaster] as
about US$8/tonne, thus US$0.008/kg, while giving the various [potassa]
products including pearl-ash as closer to US$800/tonne (US$0.80/kg) as
fertilizer, and [soda-ash] as US$150/tonne (US$0.15/kg).  Lime is
calcined from [limestone], which the USGS lumps with crushed stone in
general at US$12/tonne (US$0.012/kg), but the calcining and slaking
process is a significant cost by comparison.  Raw natural [zeolites]
have their wholesale price given as US$50–300/tonne
(US$0.05-US$0.30/kg), various [clays] as US$10–140/tonne
(US$0.01–0.14/kg), and [infusorial earth] US$310/tonne (US$0.34/kg).
The USGS report on [magnesia] gives no explicit price but it seems to
be about US$0.70/kg.  For [rock salt] they say US$60/tonne
(US$0.06/kg).

Waste plant material is often free or of negative cost, but often must
be treated to stop fire and rot.

These bulk minerals, except for pearl-ash and magnesia, have wholesale
prices in the two orders of magnitude of US$0.005-US$0.5/kg.  Probably
most industrially-produced materials are unable to approach that
range, though perhaps a few, such as lye, oil of vitriol, and muriate
of lime might make it.

[The random Russian website opt6.ru][0] offers a tonne of 99.2%-pure
muriate of lime for 21000 rubles; [a ruble is presently US$0.01294][1]
reportedly, so that’s US$272/tonne or US$0.272/kg.  This is toward the
high end of the price per kg of the cheap desiccants, and 34× the
price of calcined alabaster, but it’s still kind of within the range.
